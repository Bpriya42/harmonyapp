# Harmony Plugin

## Chrome developer installation

[Google instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world)

### TL:DR

Open chrome extensions settings: "chrome://extensions"
Toggle "Developer mode"
Click the new "Load unpacked" button
Select the chrome folder.
When the extension appears is it most useful to pin it to allow the popover features

## Deployment

Until Google approve the plugin there seems to be no way to setup a CI/CD pathway - though once we have a published ID and url we can use Github Actions to update the plugin in store.
